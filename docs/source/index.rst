Welcome to Schematell's Documentation!
             ^ IT'S SCHEMACELL GODDAMMIT
===================================

**Schemacell** (/schema'cell/) is a (nonexistant) celluar automata game
that expands on the cult classic `Cell Machine Mystic Mod <https://themysticlynx.itch.io/cell-machine-mystic-mod>`_.
Please note that this is not documentation for modifying source code
but rather the documentation for making cells.

.. note::

   This project is under active development, are so are the docs.
   We need your help to update the docs when the game releases, beecause we're too lazy to do that.
   Help us at `github.com/Schematell/docs <https://github.com/Schematell/docs>`_
